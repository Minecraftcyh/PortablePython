#### ***You can use {programname} to obtain the program name and {version} to obtain the version, when referencing internal variables, there is no need to add 'f'***

## Format:
``` json
{
  "BeforeCleanTip":"...",
  "UserManual":"...",
  "DiplayVersion":"...",
  "DevelopTip":"...",
  "Prompt":"...",
	"True":"...",
	"False":"..."
  "OutputComplexity":{
    "Concise":"...",
    "Detailed":"..."
  },
  "Word":{
    "Version":"..."
  }
}
```

``` json
{
	"BeforeCleanTip":"Previously running code will not be cleared, but the terminal will be cleared and the previous code cannot be viewed. Are you sure you want to empty it? (yes or no)>> ",
